PHP's loose typing allows duplicate keys in associative arrays, leading to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.php` offers solutions to mitigate these issues.  Understanding these pitfalls can prevent hard-to-track bugs in PHP applications.
