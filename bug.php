In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't strictly numeric.  Consider this scenario:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [
    "apple" => 1,
    "banana" => 2,
    "apple" => 3  // Duplicate key!
];

print_r($myArray);
?>
```

PHP's loose typing allows duplicate keys in associative arrays. The last assignment to a duplicate key will overwrite previous values.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly in situations where the keys represent unique identifiers.

Another example involves using variables directly as array keys. If the variable's value changes between assignments, you might encounter issues with key consistency:

```php
<?php
$key = "fruit";
$myArray = [
    $key => "apple",
];
$key = "vegetable";
$myArray[$key] = "carrot";

print_r($myArray);
?>
```

Here, the key is reassigned, resulting in two separate array entries instead of overwriting one.

These situations can be tricky to debug, especially in larger applications. Unexpected data overwrites or missing elements can cause frustrating runtime errors.
